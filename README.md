# DSA-Lab-Task-3
"A collection of recursive algorithms implemented in C++. Covers classic problems like factorial, Fibonacci and more."
**Introduction**
Recursion is a fundamental concept in programming where a function calls itself to solve a problem. This project explores various recursive algorithms in C++, demonstrating how recursion simplifies complex problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.

**Objectives**
Understand the concept of recursion and how it works.
Implement and analyze different recursive algorithms in C++.
Learn how recursion can be used to solve real-world problems efficiently.
Compare recursive and iterative approaches to problem-solving.

**Key Points Covered**
 Basics of recursion (base case & recursive case)
 Factorial calculation using recursion
 Fibonacci sequence implementation
 Tower of Hanoi problem
 Recursion in array operations (searching, sorting)
 Backtracking examples (maze solving, N-Queens problem)
 Differences between recursion and iteration
 Understanding recursion depth and stack memory usage
